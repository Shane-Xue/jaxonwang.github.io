# Me

My name is JX Wang, a first-year master student in the Graduate School of Frontier Science, University of Tokyo. I received my bachelor's degree at the College of Software Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

Before coming to Japan, I worked in the industry for 2 years focusing on SaaS cloud platforms and Big-data frameworks. Now my research domains are Parallel Computing and Distributed Systems.

Currently, I write Python and C++ most. I love Python for simplicity and C++ for flexibility and performance. I am also a big fan of functional programming. Erlang and Haskell are great!
