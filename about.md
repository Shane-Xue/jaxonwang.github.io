# Me

My name is JX Wang, a first-year master student in the Graduate School of Frontier Science, University of Tokyo. I received my bachelor's degree at the College of Software Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.

Before coming to Japan, I worked in the industry for 2 years focusing on SaaS cloud platforms and Big-data frameworks. Now my research domains are Parallel Computing and Distributed Systems. 

Programming is satisfying to me since the code is another format of math. Our universe is defined by math, so it can be expressed by code. 

Currently, I write Python and C++ most. I love Python for simplicity and C++ for performance. I am also a big fan of functional programming. Erlang and Haskell are great!
